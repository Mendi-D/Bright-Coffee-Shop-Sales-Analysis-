I was provided with a dataset titled “Bright Coffee Shop Sales”, which captures daily transactional information from a coffee shop. The business has recently appointed a new CEO whose mission is to grow the company’s revenue and improve product performance. I was then tasked to extract actionable insights from historical data and prepare a presentation to assist the CEO in decision-making.
